Sushi-ko closed in 2013, presumably due to the financial troubles, yet chef Daisuke had opened a new Sushiko in Chevy Chase, Maryland in 2008 and has been running that restaurant ever since. Chef Wei Zhang and his wife Min took over the space in 2014, applied for a liquor license and opened Sushi Keiko, as rave reviews from customers followed. Mr. Zhang was president of the company named ""Washington DC Asian Food Corporation"" which owned Sushi Keiko. Early in 2018 Mr. Zhang encountered family problems and said he needed to return to his home country, so he sold the business to Ferry Huang who apparently took over as president of the corporation.",,,,
